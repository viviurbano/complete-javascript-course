### Patente

Raramente as reuniões são eficientes em termos de tempo gasto e obtenção de resultados, especialmente reuniões com vários participantes.

Muitos fatores podem contribuir para a falta de cumprimento de metas, como o contexto da reunião, déficit de foco por parte dos jogadores, contribuintes despreparados, dados insuficientes sobre os tópicos discutidos, perturbar ou sequestrar a reunião, ausência de um objetivo ou motivação clara, pessoas essenciais falta de participar, etc.

Todos os itens mencionados e outros mais são importantes para reuniões bem-sucedidas, e a proposta descrita nesta invenção ajuda a resolver alguns desses problemas ao introduzir um sistema e um método baseado em um assistente coletivo inteligente. A patente proposta utiliza dados históricos e técnicas de análise e aprendizado para coletar dados das reuniões e enviar ativamente feedback aos participantes, ajudando-os a atingir seus próprios objetivos e, fundamentalmente, o objetivo coletivo da reunião.

Nosso método atua como apoio aos usuários para entender o contexto do assunto que será discutido e a partir do módulo de feedback fornecer as sugestões adequadas para evitar falta de informação.

Em uma situação de reunião de trabalho, o método e sistema pode ser utilizado para analisar previamente a pauta da reunião, bem como os participantes. A partir dessas informações, o método poderia sugerir que algum participante, considerando seu papel e skills, seja convidado. O método poderia também, a partir da análise da pauta, sugerir que sejam inclusos tópicos para que o contexto da reunião seja produtivo.

Ainda tendo em vista reuniões no trabalho, o método e sistema pode contribuir durante a reunião. Com base no módulo dados históricos, nossa invenção atua na validação dos tópicos, checando se em situações anteriores foram aborados mais detalhes a respeito do tópico, se é necessário que algum aspecto ainda não discutido precisa ainda ser tratado e, caso seja, quem poderia trazer o assunto à discussão.

Com base no contexto da reunião e perfil dos participantes, nossa invenção também prevê que, a partir do módulo de aprendizado, o participante receba um alerta para que em determinado momento compartilhe alguma informação ou dado que possui.
